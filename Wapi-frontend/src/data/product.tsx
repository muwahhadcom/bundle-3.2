    { question: "How do WhatsApp Forms differ from regular web forms?", answer: "Unlike traditional web forms that redirect users to external pages, WhatsApp Forms render directly inside the chat conversation. This eliminates friction, reduces drop-offs, and achieves significantly higher completion rates — users never leave the familiar WhatsApp interface." },
    { question: "Can I trigger forms automatically based on user messages?", answer: "Absolutely. Using Keyword Triggers, you can configure specific keywords (e.g. \"Apply\", \"Register\", \"Book\") to automatically deliver your form. When a user sends a matching keyword, the system responds instantly with the interactive form — no manual intervention needed." },
    { question: "What field types are available in the form builder?", answer: "The visual builder supports Text Input, Text Area, Number, Email, Phone, Dropdown, Single Choice (radio), Checkbox, and Date Picker. Each field can be configured with a display label, placeholder text, and required validation toggle." }
