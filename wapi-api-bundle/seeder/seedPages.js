When a user sends a matching keyword, the system responds instantly with the interactive form — no manual intervention needed."

              question: 'Do I need coding skills to build a WhatsApp chatbot?',
              answer: 'Absolutely not. Our Visual Editor is designed specifically for business users. You drag node blocks, link them using cursor lines, and configure triggers or responses in plain text.'
            },
            {
              question: 'How do API integrations or webhooks work?',
              answer: 'The Webhook block triggers dynamic API calls mid-conversation. For example, when a user enters an order ID, the chatbot can make a GET request to your Shopify backend, pull the status, and reply to the user automatically.'
            },
            {
              question: 'What happens when a customer needs human assistance?',
              answer: 'Our chatbot handover block routes the customer context to the Shared Team Inbox immediately. The automation stops running on that active thread, letting agents converse natively.'
